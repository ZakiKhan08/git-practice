                    <h1>Chess.com</h1>
                    <p> Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares. The goal is to checkmate the opponent's king, meaning the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and has no legal moves to escape the attack. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. <br><br>
<b>Key aspects of chess:</b><br><br>
<b>Board and Pieces:</b>
The game is played on a square board with 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. Each player controls 16 pieces of contrasting colors (usually white and black), with distinct movement patterns for each type. <br><br>
<b>Objective:</b>
The ultimate goal is to checkmate the opponent's king. This is achieved when the king is under attack and has no way to move out of the attack. <br><br>
<b>Rules:</b>
The game follows a set of rules governing how each piece can move and capture other pieces. <br><br>
<b>Strategy and Tactics:</b>
Chess is a game of strategy, requiring players to plan ahead, anticipate their opponent's moves, and use tactics to gain a positional advantage. <br><br>
<b>History:</b>
Chess originated in India around the 6th century CE and has evolved over time, with its current form taking shape in the Middle Ages. <br><br>
<b>Variations:</b>
While the standard rules are set by FIDE, there are variations such as fast chess, correspondence chess, and online chess. <br><br>
<b> Benefits:</b>
Chess is known for its intellectual stimulation, improving cognitive skills, and promoting strategic thinking.

    <div class="child_2b"><span>Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen[a] (born 30 November 1990) is a Norwegian chess grandmaster. Carlsen is a five-time World Chess Champion, five-time World Rapid Chess Champion, and the reigning (shared with Ian Nepomniachtchi) eight-time World Blitz Chess Champion. He has held the No. 1 position in the FIDE rankings since 1 July 2011, the longest consecutive streak, and trails only Garry Kasparov in time spent as the highest-rated player in the world. His peak rating of 2882 is the highest in history. He also holds the record for the longest unbeaten streak at the elite level in classical chess at 125 games.

A chess prodigy, Carlsen finished first in the C group of the Corus chess tournament shortly after he turned 13 and earned the title of grandmaster a few months later. At 15, he won the Norwegian Chess Championship, and later became the youngest ever player to qualify for the Candidates Tournament in 2005. At 17, he finished joint first in the top group of Corus. He surpassed a rating of 2800 at 18, the youngest at the time to do so. In 2010, at 19, he reached No. 1 in the FIDE world rankings, the youngest person ever to do so.

Carlsen became World Chess Champion in 2013 by defeating Viswanathan Anand. He retained his title against Anand the following year and won both the 2014 World Rapid Championship and World Blitz Championship, becoming the first player to hold all three titles simultaneously, a feat which he repeated in 2019 and 2022. He defended his classical world title against Sergey Karjakin in 2016, Fabiano Caruana in 2018, and Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021. Carlsen declined to defend his title in 2023, citing a lack of motivation.

Known for his attacking style as a teenager, Carlsen has since developed into a universal player. He uses a variety of openings to make it harder for opponents to prepare against him and reduce the utility of pre-game computer analysis. In 2025, he signed with esports organization Team Liquid and subsequently won the inaugural chess event at the 2025 Esports World Cup, becoming the first-ever Chess Esports World Cup Champion by defeating Alireza Firouzja.

A chess prodigy, he earned his grandmaster title at the age of 15, the youngest American at the time to do so. With a peak rating of 2816, Nakamura is the tenth-highest-rated player in history.
